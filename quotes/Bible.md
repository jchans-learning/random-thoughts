「你聽見有吩咐古人的話，說：『不可殺人』；又說：『凡殺人的難免受審判。』只是我告訴你們，凡對兄弟動怒的，難免受審判；凡罵兄弟是拉加的，難免公會的審斷；凡罵兄弟是魔利的，難免地獄的火。所以，你在祭壇上獻禮物的時候，若想起弟兄向你懷怨，就把禮物留在壇前，先去同弟兄和好，然後來獻禮物。你同告你的對頭還在路上，就趕緊與他和息，恐怕他把你送給審判官，審判官交付衙役，你就下在監裡了。我實在告訴你若有一文錢沒有還清，你斷不能從那裡出來。」

馬太福音 5:21~5:26

“Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in the danger of the judgment:But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.”

Matthew 5:21~5:26
